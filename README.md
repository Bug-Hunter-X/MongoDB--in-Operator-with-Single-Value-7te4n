# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Value
This example demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries when dealing with a single value.  The `$in` operator is designed for checking if a field matches any value in an array, and using it with a single value will not produce the expected result.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle this scenario.
